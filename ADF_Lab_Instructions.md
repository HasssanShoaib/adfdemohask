# ADF Lab

*Get One liner from Anand*

In this Lab, we will utilize Azure Data Factory's visual authoring experience to create a pipeline that copies data stored in Amazon S3 to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and then executes a Mapping Data Flow to transform and write to a SQL data ware house.

## Prerequisites

* **Azure subscription**: If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* **Azure storage account**: Use Blob storage as the _source_ data store. If you don't have an Azure storage account, see the instructions in [Create a storage account](../storage/common/storage-quickstart-create-account.md).
